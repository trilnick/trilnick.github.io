I'm an economist and data scientist, currently working at Google. I have a PhD in Agricultural and Resource Economics from UC Berkeley, where I was doing research in agriculture, energy, the environment, and the links between them. I also did some work in public and labor economics.

I created this website in graduate school, and some of the information here might not be up to date. Here is my <a href="trilnick_resume.pdf" target="_blank">industry oriented resume</a>. I'm happy to chat about my research.
