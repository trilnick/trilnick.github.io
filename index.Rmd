I am a PhD candidate at the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at UC Berkeley. I'm interested in agriculture, energy, the environment, and the links between them. I'm also interested in public and labor economics.

I'm on the job market! <a href="jmp.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to read my job market paper.</a> I'll be attending the AEA meetings in Atlanta this coming January.  If you'd like to meet there, feel free to contact me.

This is me on a good day:
