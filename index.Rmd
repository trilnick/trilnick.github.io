I'm an economist and data scientist, currently working at Google. I have a PhD in Agricultural and Resource Economics from UC Berkeley, where I was doing research in agriculture, energy, the environment, and the links between them. I also did some work in public and labor economics.

I created this website while on the job market, and some of the information here might not be up to date. Here are my <a href="itai_trilnick_cv.pdf" target="_blank">academic cv</a> and an <a href="trilnick_resume.pdf" target="_blank">industry oriented resume</a>. I have a cool job market paper on climate change and agriculture, <a href="jmp.pdf" target="_blank">click here to read it</a>.
